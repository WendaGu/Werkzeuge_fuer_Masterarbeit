# ellipse-generator
Scripts and tools written for generating ellipse.

Generate images with ellipse under different conditions for simulating the image of the droplet obtained in the experiment.

The program can create ellipse of random position and size, and can determine whether the ellipse overlaps and whether the ellipse is truncated (beyond the image boundary).

In order to improve the difficulty of machine learning, different filters can be added to the image, such as adding noise to the image, image distortion, image blurring, background color gradient change, etc.
