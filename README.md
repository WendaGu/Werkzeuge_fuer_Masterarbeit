Generate images with ellipsen under different conditions for simulating the image of the droplet obtained in the experiment.

The program can create ellipse of random position and size, and can determine whether the ellipse overlaps and whether the ellipse is truncated (beyond the image boundary).

In order to improve the difficulty of machine learning, you can choose to add different filters to the image, such as adding noise to the image, image distortion, image blurring, background color gradient change, etc.
